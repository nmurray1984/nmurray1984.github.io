This is a sample post to demonstrate how the blog works.

## Adding New Posts

To add a new post, create a file in the `_posts` folder with the naming format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md
```

Each post needs frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown below the frontmatter.
