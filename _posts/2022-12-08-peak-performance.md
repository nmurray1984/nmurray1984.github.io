We see God's everyday miracles best when we are fully engaged. When we are fully engaged, we are trying our hardest and using the capabilities God has given us - rationality and agency - to most clearly define and shape our expectations. We work towards outcomes. And in that work, we butt up against our limitations. If we are only partially engaged and God performs a miracle, we have an excuse - that perhaps if I had tried harder, worked longer, used better words in a conversation, or prepared better - maybe that miracle would have happened anyways. Conversely when we have tried our hardest and exhausted our capability and energy, it is clear what work is God's and which is ours. And it is in those moments that you *feel* the love of God. It is no longer a rational, apologetic understanding of what God has done throughout history. It is real, concrete, delibratate, and all-consuming.

Therefore, when you are not fully engaged, you are not seeing all that God has for you.
